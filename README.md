This project is still alpha, development and testing is ongoing.  Be aware that breaking changes may occur.

What is globatio?
----------------

It is an experimental digital currency based on a distributed ledger consisting of a mainchain and multiple sidechains. Initially, the native cryptocurrency is created in the mainchain through a very secure decentralized (but also slow and restricted) proof-of-work mining and then can be stacked to initiate or participate in sidechains with very fast proof-of-stack mining.

In particular, globatio desktop is a wallet along with an integrated lightweight miner that allows early miners to collect globatio mainchain coins.
